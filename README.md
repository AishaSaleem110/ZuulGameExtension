# zuul-bad-extended

This is an extension of Zuul game with massive refactoring to implement Object Oriented Principles, Responsibility designing and Design Patterns to add support for new features.

# Background
For some unknown reason (1980s nostalgia?), the small games company that you work for has decided to produce a new adventure game, The World of Zuul. The company hopes that this will be the First of a series of products (some in the Zuul series, others quite different but all sharing
the same underlying structure). It is therefore essential that the code produced is easy to maintain and to extend. They plan to release games in single-player and multi-player versions. They also intend to have some AI (artificial intelligence) | computer-controlled characters than can move
through the game.
My task is to produce an initial prototype with a simple command-line interface. The module page contains a link to a zip file
of his prototype, zuul-bad-extended.zip. I save a copy of this file , read his code and despair: it is dreadful. It clearly cannot be extended in its present form, yet alone support any of your company's ambitions (see above). Clearly, you are going to have to refactor
it before it meets all these goals.

# New features
Add the following features from the company's wish-list.
• Support for more than one player.
• Support for computer-controlled characters.
• A solution that will allow new actions to be added efficiently and with minimal (or no) changes to code that you have already written.
• Support to allow dierent user interfaces to be added . Note that you do not have to implement a GUI or other new interface.
